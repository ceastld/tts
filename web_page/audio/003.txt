These deficiencies in the generation results are closely related to the control signals used by these diffusion models. For example, the information of landmarks is too sparse, making it hard to capture detailed facial muscle movements or accurately describe head poses. Depth maps and normal maps only represent specific geometric attributes and are inherently camera-dependent, lacking 3D consistency. When such 3D inconsistent control signals are introduced into diffusion, the inconsistency in the generation results is further amplified.
